# Kabelwerk Inbox Item

The `<KabelwerkInboxItem>` component displays information about a chat room and the latest message in that room (if there is such).

Most probably you will not directly use the `<KabelwerkInboxItem>` component in your code â€” on the contrary, it is likely that you will want to replace it with a component of your own.

## Props

### `item`

An inbox item object.

### `onPress`

Called when the component is pressed by the user.
