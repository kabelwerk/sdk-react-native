# Kabelwerk Room

The `<KabelwerkRoom>` component renders a chat room.

## Example

```jsx
<KabelwerkRoom roomId={roomId} />
```

## Props

### `roomId`

The ID of the room to render. If this prop is not set, a random room belonging to the connected user will be rendered â€” which is useful when you have a single hub.
