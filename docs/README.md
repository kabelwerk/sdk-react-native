# Getting started

Welcome to the documentation of [Kabelwerk](https://kabelwerk.io)'s SDK for React Native!

## Installation

The SDK is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kabelwerk-react-native).

```bash npm2yarn
npm install kabelwerk-react-native
```

Releases follow semantic versioning. Make sure to check the [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) whenever upgrading to a newer version.

The SDK builds on top of (and includes as a dependency) the [Kabelwerk SDK for JavaScript](https://docs.kabelwerk.io/js/).
