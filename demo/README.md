# Kabelwerk Demo

A simple React Native app showcasing the Kabelwerk SDK for React Native.

## Android

To check out the Kabelwerk Demo app on Android:

- Install the [Expo Go](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) app from Google Play Store.
- Visit [expo.dev/@kabelwerk/demo](https://expo.dev/@kabelwerk/demo) and scan the QR code to open the latest demo build.

## iOS

Due to restrictions of app distribution on iOS, you need to be explicitly invited to test the demo app:

- [Get in touch](mailto:hello@kabelwerk.io) and we will send you an inviation; you will have to create an Expo account if you do not already have one.
- Install the [Expo Go](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779) app from Apple's App Store and login with your Expo account.
- Open the latest demo build from the Profile tab of the Expo Go app.

## Run locally

You can also run the app locally â€” on an emulator or a physical device connected to your computer:

```sh
# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/kabelwerk/sdk-react-native

# open the project dir
cd sdk-react-native

# install the SDK dependencies
npm install

# open the demo dir
cd demo
